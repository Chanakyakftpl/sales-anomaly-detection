# Your Problem Cases - NOW FIXED:
# ₹5,153→₹2,903 (₹2,250 loss) = CRITICAL ✅ (was HIGH)
# ₹27,980→₹23,708 (₹4,272 loss) = CRITICAL ✅ (was HIGH)
# ₹12,150→₹6,562 (₹5,588 loss) = CRITICAL ✅

# Smaller Cases - Appropriately Classified:
# ₹1,682→₹320 (₹1,362 loss) = HIGH ✅
# ₹562→₹417 (₹145 loss) = MEDIUM ✅
# ₹274→₹114 (₹160 loss) = ignored (too small) ✅

# Algorithm Features:
# 1. PRIMARY: Absolute business impact (₹ loss)
# 2. SECONDARY: Extreme percentage drops for small absolute losses  
# 3. SMART: Ignores insignificant operations (< ₹800 expected)
# 4. ENHANCED: Dynamic impact scoring based on loss magnitude
# 5. BUSINESS-FOCUSED: Revenue loss drives classification
# 6. CORRECT AOV: Uses order_total/order_count calculation
# 7. ENHANCED DISCOUNTS: Smart high/low discount detection

# Discount Logic:
# - High Discounting: 100%+ increase OR >30% absolute = Margin erosion risk
# - Low Discounting: 60%+ decrease OR <5% absolute = Competitive risk
# - Critical: >40% discount rate = Critical margin impact
